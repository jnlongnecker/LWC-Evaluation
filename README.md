# Lightning Web Component Evaluation

This assignment is here to assess your abilities in creating Lightning Web Components. The developer content for B2B Commerce requires a fairly high level of competency in creating and reading Lightning Web Components.

## Scenario

United Solar is interested in creating a new app for their Salesforce environment and would like your assistance. They have a few Accounts that have high numbers of Contacts and they would like a component that would display information about the Contacts associated to the Account ordered by number of calls logged for that Contact. This information would specifically be their name and any contact information like their phone number and email address. They would like the number of Contacts displayed to be adjustable. They would also like it if when a Contact was clicked, an existing component that their developers have written would be updated containing the information of the Contact that was just clicked. This component already exists on their page and shouldn't be duplicated; it is provided solely so you can verify its compatibility with your component.

## Instructions

- Create a branch on this repository following this naming convention: FirstName-LastName. There is an existing branch with my name as an example.
- Create an SFDX project with *only* your component(s) inside it and any customizations necessary for your component(s) to function.
- Pull in the Lightning Web Component, Lightning Message Channel, and Apex Class already created.
- Develop your component(s) to solve the scenario described above. Make any customizations necessary for completion of the scenario.
  - You should have a single component following this naming convention: solutionFirstnameLastname. This should be the single component asked for in the scenario. Any child components should be well-named.
  - The component given (contactDisplay) should NOT be a child component and will be displayed separately on the page.
- Upload your code to your branch. Ensure that I can deploy your component to a fresh Trailhead Playground and verify its functionality.
- You'll find feedback in the README to your branch once I've gone over it.

Be sure to ask me if you have any questions or need to make any clarifications to the scenario or instructions above.
